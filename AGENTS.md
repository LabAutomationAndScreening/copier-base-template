- Comments should be used very rarely. Generally the code should speak for itself.
- Never create a single-line docstring. Either the function should clearly describe what it does, or it is something with very complex behavior that requires a detailed docstring.
- Don't spend time sorting or removing imports within code files. The pre-commit hooks will do that.
- Always include type hints for pyright in Python
